# AssociativeLogic

## Basic Idea
1. Create a graph of concepts by reading and pulling out concepts and relationships.
2. Feed a situation into the above world model (graph) to activate a certain group of nodes.
3. Flow the activation along graph edges to get the next logical concept (activated group of nodes).
4. See how the thought progresses to next logical concepts/actions.

## Mini Demo
The below script shows the basic concept of logical flow ("thinking").
```
python concept.py
If I use mouthwash the likely outcome is: 
Fresh breath

If I use toothpaste the unlikely outcome is: 
Cavities
```

## ToDo
* Select an open source graph or write a dict-based one.
* Optimize for speed of finding nodes.
