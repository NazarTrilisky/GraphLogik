There was once a very rich merchant, who had six children, three sons, and three daughters;

being a man of sense, he spared no cost for their education, but gave them all kinds of masters.

His daughters were extremely handsome, especially the youngest.

When she was little everybody admired her, and called her "The little Beauty;"

so that, as she grew up, she still went by the name of Beauty, which made her sisters very jealous.
